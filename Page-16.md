It's not exactly the life I Dreamed of as a kid...

But my accident motivates me every day...

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)   ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  

To find out the truth!...

 I wish my brother was as strong-willed as you are...

I guess we're all just...

...Different!...

How was everything, ladies?...

Care for some dessert?, coffee?...

 ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)   ![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)
 
 Um, maybe we should go?...
 
![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

Oh Shot!... We've been chatting for like an hour!

![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

We'll have to pick up the pace a little. Being late is no laughing matter at DV!...

 ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)   ![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)
 
 No problem, let's go!...
