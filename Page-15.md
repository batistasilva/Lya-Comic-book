Have you been working at the firm long?...

![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png) 

Long enough to know everybody!...

Who knows? But if you've got a lot of money and problems with the law, we're your best shot...

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Adéle](images/adele-1.png) 

So does it really live up to it's fabulous reputation?

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Adéle](images/adele-1.png) 

Right. I hear Mr. De Villegan is the man of the hour...

'Cause of the librexpress case?...

![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

He's big news right now, anyway...

Yep, that's the biggest case of the year!...

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Adéle](images/adele-1.png) 

And Clément is his assistant?...

![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

Yeah!...

He's not a bad guy... Just a boss pet...

![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

Oops, I shouldn't have said that!

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Adéle](images/adele-1.png) 

I'll take it to my grave!...

![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

Sorry, can I ask a personal question? 

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Adéle](images/adele-1.png) 

Sure!...

![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

You don't have to answer, you know!...

But what happened to you?...

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Adéle](images/adele-1.png) 

No worries!... I was... In an accident!...

![Adéle](images/adele-1.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

My brother has cerebral palsy. He uses a wheelchair too...

It's nice to see it hasn't stopped you from living life!...
