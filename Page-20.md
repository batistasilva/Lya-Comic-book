That night:

![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

What're you gonna do?

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)

I don't know yet!...

I'm thinking... 

![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

And I can't talk you out of it?

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)

You know me too well!...

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)

Inside that file is the name of the monster who left me for dead on the side of the road!...

And he's walking around on two legs, while I'm stuck in this thing!!...

![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

I know. But how could your parents have hidden it from you?

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)

He bought them off, but I need his name!

And for him to pay for what he did...

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)

I thing all that mattered to my parents was that I was alive...

Someone gave them enough money for my treatment at Belfont, for mom to quit work, and for them to renovate the apartment.  I don't blame them, I know they love me...

They did what they thought was best for me. And i'd never have known if I hadn't found that letter from Mr. de Villegan in Antoine's office...

They say They don't know who it was.

![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)  ![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)

Maybe not. But someone clearly paid them!...

![Lya](images/Lya-01.png)  ![Antoine](images/Antoine-avatar-90x90.png)

Don't worry. 

One day, I'll have a long talk with my parents.

But I don't think they had a choice...

It seems like whoever it was has a lot of influence...
