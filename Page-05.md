Hi, Lya! ready to take the Plunge `[pl…ônj]`?

I was born ready!...

Do you need sheets, too?

Nope! I've got everything I need.

It's not like I'm going to Australia, mom. I'll just be downtown...

It'll be so much easier for my internship.

I know. But it's the first time you'll be away from home since...

My accident...

I know, mom...

Relax! it's all gonna be fine.

Uh... You remember how small my place is?...

![](images/Lya-01.png)

I packed only...

...The bare essentials!...

![](images/Dad.png)

Ready to go?

![](images/Lya-01.png)

Yeah!....

Actually.. There's that one, too...
